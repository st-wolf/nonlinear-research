\section{Introduction \label{sec:introduction}}

For last decade investigations of exciton polariton Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in various type of semiconductor microstructures represent one of mainstreams of current photonic and semiconductor technologies, see e.g. \cite{Sanvitto,Guillet}.
The microcavity exciton polaritons are bosonic quasiparticles representing  admixtures of the quantized cavity mode and quantum wells excitons.
Practically, semiconductor microcavities are promising for various optoelectronic applications where quantum  matter-field interface plays crucial role.
In particular, demonstrations of polariton laser with electrical pump \cite{Bhattacharya,Schneider}, amplifiers \cite{Niemietz}, switches \cite{Amo_2010}, transistors \cite{Ballarini}, polariton circuits and optical logic elements \cite{Sturm,Liew}.
Although exciton polariton condensates exhibits Bose-Einstein statistics under the phase transition condition and macroscopic occupation of the ground state at certain pumping rate that is less than for convenient lasers, they are not in true thermodynamic equilibrium state \cite{Byrnes_2014,Sun}.
  
Non-equilibrium, or, thermodynamically quasi-equilibrium features of exciton polariton condensates play certain role in various manifestations of their collective (many body) quantum states such as superfluidity \cite{Carusotto_2013,Amo_2009}, quantized vortices \cite{Lagoudakis_2008,Lagoudakis_2009}, soliton formation \cite{Sich}, Josephson oscillations and macroscopic self-trapping \cite{Abbarchi,Lagoudakis_2010}.
Since exciton polariton BEC's in present experiments examined at high enough (up to the room) temperatures the quantum character of such a states should be examined even at equilibrium.

The problem of distinguishability of statistically classical and quantum regimes for exciton polariton condensates behavior is very actual for their practical purposes, see e.g. \cite{Dominici}; especially for their possible applications for quantum information science purposes.
Fast switching properties (the typical switching time of a few picoseconds), relatively strong nonlinear response and flexibility to external optical and/or electrical pump, spin degrees of freedom made microcavity polaritons potentially very promising for quantum computation and quantum information processing objectives, see, e.g. \cite{Demirchyan,Pagel,Kyriienko,Solnyshkov_2015, Dominici}.
Especially it is important to stress quantum annealing problem \cite{Yan} that is very actual now and where collective (bosonic) character of polariton BEC could be used.
In particular, as it is shown recently in \cite{Lewenstein} global minimum of energy landscape can be reached at finite temperatures via a combination of thermal annealing and quantum tunneling. 

Another promising area of potential applications of quantum exciton polariton states is connected with quantum metrology purposes for which designing of quantum interferometers and gyroscopes possessing high precision measurements with quantum phase states is utilized, cf. \cite{Pezze, Gulevich}.
  
In the paper we consider generic problem  of quantum-classical phase transition (see e.g.\cite{Chudnovsky_1997}) with exciton polariton condensates occurring in semiconductor microcavity in the presence of Josephson effect, cf. \cite{Aleiner, Shelykh_2008, Borgh_2010}.
In general this problem relates to dissipative tunneling problem or, tunneling at finite (non-zero) temperatures models, cf. \cite{Caldeira, Larkin, Riseborough}.
Traditionally  seminal studies on this topic are based on consideration of superconductor devices \cite{Ankerhold} where macroscopic tunneling plays essential role.
In particular, it is worth to mention here Schr\"odinger cat state formation \cite{Leggett} and design of quantum gates for quantum computing with superconductor qubits where macroscopic quantum coherent phase properties are used \cite{Makhlin}.
Latterly the problem of quantum tunneling and quantum-classical phase transition problem have been applied to other two-level (spin) systems, like atomic BEC's \cite{Zhang}, and small ferromagnetic particles, \cite{Owerre}.
Strictly speaking main discussion is focused on investigation of quantum-classical escape rate transition that takes place in the presence of potential barrier at finite temperatures.
  
In the paper we propose \textit{extended model} for exciton polariton Josephson junctions that relates to so-called non-standard Bose-Hubbard models (see \cite{Dutta} and references therein) when energy of polariton-polariton scattering contributes into the tunneling parameter, cf. \cite{Aleiner, Shelykh_2008, Borgh_2010, Solnyshkov_2008, Sarchi}.
In particularly, we pay our attention to temperature dependent quantum critical phenomena occurring in the presence of macroscopic tunneling.
We aimed at elucidation of necessary criteria to obtain quantum phase regimes with trapped exciton polaritons suitable for creation of exciton polariton qubit gates.

This paper is arranged as follows.
In Sec. \ref{sec:model} we explain in details our model to realize Josephson junction with exciton polariton condensates.
The extended tight-binding model will be established in this case.
In Sec. \ref{sec:quantum_phase} we {\red \dots }.
In the conclusion, we summarize the results obtained.

\section{THE MODEL OD EXCITON POLARITON JOSEPHSON JUNCTION \label{sec:model}}

We start by describing the problem of equilibrium exciton polariton condensate trapping in symmetric one dimensional double-well potential $U(x) = h ((x/x_0)^2 - 1)^2$, sketched in the Fig. \ref{pic:potential_sym_asym}; $2x_0$ defines distance between potential minima, $h$ depth of the potential.
% 
\begin{figure}[ht]
\center{\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{pic/potential_sym_asym.png}}
\caption{
Confined double-well potential for exciton polariton coupled condensate channels with symmetric $(\Phi_+(x))$ and asymmetric $(\Phi_-(x))$ wavefunctions obtained numerically by solving stationary GPE (\ref{eq:stationary}).
The dimensionless parameters for the calculations are: $h = 10$, $x_0 = 1$, $\mu_+ = 5.7355$, $\mu_- = 6.5653$.
\label{pic:potential_sym_asym}
}
\end{figure}
%
The Hamiltonian for the system of weakly interacting exciton polaritons in an external $U(x)$ can be written in the second quantized form as:
%
\begin{equation}
\hat{H} = \int \Big\{ -\dfrac{1}{2} \hat{\psi}^\dag \dfrac{d^2 \hat{\psi}}{dx^2} + \hat{\psi}^\dag \hat{\psi} U(x) + \dfrac{g}{2} \hat{\psi}^{\dag 2} \hat{\psi}^2  \Big\} dx,
\label{eq:gpe_hamiltonian}
\end{equation}
%
where $\hat{\psi} \equiv \hat{\psi}(x, t)$ is a polariton field operator that annihilate a particle at the position $x$ and time $t$, $g$ is two-body (polariton-polariton) scattering length.
In the paper we use so-called two-mode representation of $\hat{\psi}$ - operator supposing
%
\begin{equation}
\hat{\psi} = \hat{\psi}_1(t) \Phi_1(x) + \hat{\psi}_2(t) \Phi_2(x),
\label{eq:two_modes}
\end{equation}
%
where $\hat{\psi}_{1,2}$ are time dependent operators characterizing condensate at the left and at the right wells respectively; $\Phi_{1,2}(x)$ are condensate wavefunctions which are responsible for it spatial distribution.
It's instructive to recast $\Phi_{1,2}(x)$ as
%
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{1,2} = \dfrac{\Phi_+ \pm \Phi_-}{\sqrt{2}}
\label{eq:basic_modes}
\end{equation}
%
where $\Phi_{\pm}(x) = \pm \Phi_{\pm}(-x)$ are symmetric $\Phi_+$ and antisymmetric $\Phi_-$ real wavefunctions obeying stationary Gross-Pitaevskii equations, respectively
%
\begin{equation}
\mu_{\pm} \Phi_{\pm} = -\dfrac{1}{2} \dfrac{d^2 \Phi_{\pm}}{dx^2} + U(x) \Phi_{\pm} + g \Phi_{\pm}^3.
\label{eq:stationary}
\end{equation}
%
and normalization condition $\int \Phi_{\pm}^2 dx = 1$.
Here $\mu_{\pm}$ are chemical potentials.
As a result an operator $\hat{\psi_1}^\dag\hat{\psi_1} + \hat{\psi_2}^\dag\hat{\psi_2} = N$ characterizes total number of particles (here and thereafter we omit ``hat'' design for simplicity).
Substituting (\ref{eq:basic_modes}), (\ref{eq:two_modes}) into (\ref{eq:gpe_hamiltonian}) we arrive to
% 
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lcl}
\hat{H} & = & \dfrac{A}{2} (\hat{\psi}_1^{\dag 2} \hat{\psi}_1^2 + \hat{\psi}_2^{\dag 2} \hat{\psi}_2^2) - \dfrac{G}{2} (\hat{\psi}_1^\dag \hat{\psi}_2 + \hat{\psi}_1 \hat{\psi}_2^\dag) \\ [8pt]
& & -\dfrac{\Gamma}{2} (\hat{\psi}_1^{\dag 2} \hat{\psi}_1 \hat{\psi}_2 + \hat{\psi}_1^\dag \hat{\psi}_1^2 \hat{\psi}_2^\dag + \hat{\psi}_1^\dag \hat{\psi}_2^\dag \hat{\psi}_2^2 + \hat{\psi}_1 \hat{\psi}_2^{\dag 2} \hat{\psi}_2) \\ [8pt]
& & +\dfrac{C}{2} (\hat{\psi}_1^{\dag 2} \hat{\psi}_2^2 + 4 \hat{\psi}_1^\dag \hat{\psi}_1 \hat{\psi}_2^\dag \hat{\psi}_2 + \hat{\psi}_1^2 \hat{\psi}_2^{\dag 2}),
\end{array}
\label{eq:hamiltonian}
\end{equation}
%
where we made some denotations
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
\gamma_{ij} = g \int \Phi_i^2 \Phi_j^2 dx, \quad i,j \in \{+,-\}; \\
A = \frac{1}{4} (\gamma_{++} + \gamma_{--} + 6 \gamma_{+-}); \quad \Gamma = \frac{1}{2} (\gamma_{++} - \gamma_{--}); \\
C = \frac{1}{4} (\gamma_{++} + \gamma_{--} - 2\gamma_{+-}); \quad G = \mu_- - \mu_+ - 2\Gamma.
\end{array}
\label{eq:subs}
\end{equation}
Hamiltonian (\ref{eq:hamiltonian}) represents extended model for internal Josephson junction effect with exciton polariton BEC trapped in double-well potential.
The ``additional'' terms with $\Gamma$ and $C$ in (\ref{eq:hamiltonian}) characterize density induced and pair tunneling, respectively.
Generally, our model implies existence of quantum tunneling of the particles between wells with effective (nonlinear) tunneling rate $G_{eff} = \dfrac{1}{2}(G+\Gamma N - C\hat{\psi}_1^\dag\hat{\psi}_2)$.
The contribution from relevant coefficients on can be estimated from variational ansatz
%
\begin{equation}
\Phi_{\pm} = A_{\pm} \Big[ \exp \Big( -\dfrac{(x - x_0)^2}{2 a^2} \Big) \pm \exp \Big( -\dfrac{(x + x_0)^2}{2 a^2} \Big) \Big]
\label{eq:two_modes_eq}
\end{equation}
%
where $a$ is width of condensate wavefunctions at each wells (we suppose them equal to each other), defined from normalization conditions.
In Fig. \ref{pic:gamma_pm_vs_g} the behavior of normalized coefficients $\dfrac{\gamma_{ij}}{g}$ $i,j \in \{+,-\}$ as a function of half of intra-well distance $x_0$ is shown.
It is important that at differences between them rapidly vanishes with increasing of distance $x_0$.
We can suppose $\Gamma = C = 0$ for $x_0 >> a$.
This limit exactly corresponds to familiar problem of two weakly linked condensates at zero temperature, see e.g. \cite{Aleiner, Shelykh_2008, Borgh_2010, Raghavan}.

\section{The Quantum Phase \label{sec:quantum_phase}}

To elucidate purely quantum phase features of our extended Josephson model it is fruitful to recast Hamiltonian (\ref{eq:hamiltonian}) through the pseudo-spin operators defined as
% 
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\hat{S}_x = & \dfrac{1}{2} (\hat{\psi}_1^\dag \hat{\psi}_2 + \hat{\psi}_1 \hat{\psi}_2^\dag) = s \cos{\phi} - \sin{\phi} \dfrac{d}{d \phi}, \\
\quad \hat{S}_y = & \dfrac{i}{2} (\hat{\psi}_1^\dag \hat{\psi}_2 - \hat{\psi}_1 \hat{\psi}_2^\dag) = s \sin{\phi} + \cos{\phi} \dfrac{d}{d \phi}, \\
\hat{S}_z = & \dfrac{1}{2} (\hat{\psi}_2^\dag \hat{\psi}_2 + \hat{\psi}_1^\dag \hat{\psi}_1) = -i\dfrac{d}{d \phi},
\end{align}
\label{eq:pseudo_spin}
\end{subequations}
%
where $s = \dfrac{N}{2} >> 1$ is large { C - number}, $\phi$ is the phase variable.
The operators determined in Eq. (\ref{eq:pseudo_spin}) obey familiar $SU(2)$ algebra commutation relations $[S_x, S_y] = iS_z, \quad[S_z, S_x] = iS_y, \quad[S_y, S_z] = iS_x$.

After straitforward calculations from (\ref{eq:hamiltonian}) one can obtain
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lcl}
H & = & -(\alpha - \beta \sin^2 \phi) \dfrac{d^2}{d \phi^2} - (\beta(s-\dfrac{1}{2})\sin{2\phi} - B\sin{\phi}) \dfrac{d}{d \phi} \\
&& - Bs \cos \phi - \beta s^2 \sin^2 \phi - \beta s \cos^2 \phi.
\end{array}
\label{eq:hamiltinian_s}
\end{equation}
%
where $\alpha = A - C = 2\gamma_{\pm} > 0$, $\beta = 2C > 0$ and $B = \Gamma N + G > 0$.
Below we chose $x_0$ obeying to condition $\gamma_{++} \simeq \gamma_{--} = \gamma$ supposing $\Gamma = 0$ for simplicity, see Fig. \ref{pic:gamma_pm_vs_g}

Schrodinger equation with Hamiltonian (\ref{eq:hamiltinian_s}) looks like  
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
(\alpha - \beta \sin^2 \phi) \dfrac{d^2 \Phi}{d \phi^2} + (\beta(s - \dfrac{1}{2})\sin{2\phi}-B\sin{\phi})) \dfrac{d \Phi}{d \phi} \\
+ (E + BS \cos \phi + \beta S^2 \sin^2 \phi + \beta S \cos^2 \phi) = 0.
\end{array}
\label{eq:schrodinger}
\end{equation}
%
where $\Phi \equiv \Phi(\phi)$ is unknown $2\pi$-periodic wavefunction that characterizes quantum phase properties, cf. \cite{Anglin}.
Noticing that Eqs. (\ref{eq:hamiltinian_s}), (\ref{eq:schrodinger}) can be obtained by applying so-called phase-state representation, {\red cf. [  ]}.
%
\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi} = \dfrac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} d \phi \Phi(\phi) \ket{\phi}
\end{equation}
%
where
%
\begin{equation}
\ket{\phi} = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{N!}} \Big[ e^{i\phi/2} \psi_1^\dagger + e^{-i \phi/2} \psi_2^\dag \Big]^N \ket{0}_1\ket{0}
\end{equation}
%
is macroscopic coherent spin-state (macroscopic qubit state) that plays important role in current quantum information protocols operating with $N$-particle condensates, cf. \cite{Byrnes_2012}.
It is possible to eliminate the term with first derivative in Eq. (\ref{eq:schrodinger}) applying the transformation
%
\begin{equation}
\Phi(\phi) = \Psi(z) \exp \Big( s \ln \dn{z} - \dfrac{\Lambda s}{2 \sqrt{\lambda (1 - \lambda)}} \arctan \Big( \sqrt{\dfrac{\lambda}{1 - \lambda}} \cn{z} \Big) \Big)
\label{eq:transformation_of_phi}
\end{equation}
%
where $z = \int \limits_0^\phi \dfrac{d \xi}{\sqrt{1 - \lambda \sin^2 \xi}} = F(\phi, \lambda)$ is new phase variable; $F(\phi, \lambda)$ is incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind.
In (\ref{eq:transformation_of_phi}) we have introduced dimension-less vital parameters $\Lambda = \dfrac{G}{\alpha s}$, $\lambda = \dfrac{\beta}{\alpha}$ completely characterizing our model.

Inserting (\ref{eq:transformation_of_phi}) into (\ref{eq:schrodinger}) we arrive to convenient Schr\"odinger equation
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2 m} \frac{d^2\Psi}{dz^2} + (E - V(z))\Psi = 0
\label{eq:schrodinger_usual}
\end{equation}
%
for quantum particle with ``mass'' $m = \dfrac{1}{2 \alpha}$, energy $E$, that moves in the potential $V(z) = \alpha s^2 V_0(z)$ with
%
\begin{equation}
V_0(z) = \frac{ (\frac{1}{4} \Lambda^2 - \lambda (1 - \lambda)) \sn^2{z} - \Lambda \cn{z}}{\dn^2{z}}
\label{eq:potential}
\end{equation}
%

The results known for quantum phase mesoscopic Josephson junction model can be recovered from (\ref{eq:schrodinger_usual}), (\ref{eq:potential}) at $\lambda = 0$.
The dependence of the $\lambda$ parameter on normalized half of intra-well distance $\dfrac{x_0}{a}$ can be estimated from (\ref{eq:subs}), (\ref{eq:two_modes_eq}) and reads as $\lambda = 0.5 \Big( \exp \Big[ \dfrac{2 x_0^2}{a^2} \Big] - 1 \Big)^{-1}$.
The limit $\lambda = 0$ obtained for infinitely large intra-well distances $x_0 \to \infty$.
On the other hand, parameter grows rapidly at $\dfrac{x_0}{a} \ll 1$.
Obviously, in this limit our Josephson junction model inherent based on relatively weak coupling between wells breaks down.
Below we examine case of $0 < \lambda < 1$ that could be obtained at moderate values $\dfrac{x_0}{a}$ of such as $\dfrac{x_0}{a} \geq 0.45$. 

Analysis of the quantum phase for exciton polariton junctions we examine in three domains of  governed parameter $\Lambda$, cf. \cite{Anglin}.
The dependences of trapping potential $V_0(x)$ are shown in Fig. \ref{phase_potential}.
The period of the functions is determined as $4K(\lambda)$.
%

\caption{

Points $z_{1,2}$ and $z_{3}$ in (b) corresponds to global and local minima of the potential, correspondingly,  occurring with periodicity $4K(\lambda)$. \label{phase_potential}}
\end{figure}
%

\textit{Rabi regime} $\Lambda \gg 1$. In this limit the trapping potential reads $V_R(z) = \dfrac{1}{4} \Lambda^2 \sd^2{z}$.
Physically, for any value of $\lambda$ -- parameter taken from the domain $\lambda <1$ we can obtain phase (Rabi) oscillations.
In particular, small amplitude oscillations which are inherent to familiar Rabi regime can be achieved for negligable $\lambda$ --- see Fig. \ref{phase_potential}a and cf. \cite{Anglin}.
Below we are not interesting in this regime. 

\textit{Josephson regime} $1/N^2\ll\Lambda <1$.
This regime represents intermediate case between Rabi and Fock limits --- see Fig. \ref{phase_potential}b.
The behavior of the phase depends on the ratio between parameters $\Lambda$ and $\lambda$.
If $\Lambda \ge 2\lambda$ the $V_0(z)$ posses minima at $z = 0$ and $V(0) = -\Lambda$.
Frequency of small amplitude ($z \ll 1$) oscillations can be obtained from (\ref{eq:potential}) and looks like { \red $\omega_{0, quantum} = 2 \alpha s \sqrt{\frac{1}{4} \Lambda^2 - \frac{\Lambda}{2} (2\lambda - 1) - \lambda(1 - \lambda)}$ }.

In the other limit, for $\Lambda < 2 \lambda$, quantum particle is trapped at two minima of $V_0(z)$ $W$ -- like potential with coordinates $\cn{z_{min}} = \frac{\Lambda}{2 \lambda}$ and appearing for both of Josephson and Fock regimes, cf. Fig. \ref{phase_potential}b,c.  
The depth of the potential minima depends on the $\lambda$ parameter.
It is interesting to note that for $\Lambda > 2(1 - \lambda)$ potential $V_0(z)$ presumes local minimum at $\pm 2 K(\lambda)$ that is marked by red point $C$ in Fig.3b.

\textit{Fock regime} $\Lambda \ll 1/N^2$.
In purely quantum limit the two mode system approaches by the state $\ket{\psi} \propto (\psi_1^\dag)^s (\psi_1^\dag)^s \ket{0}_1 \ket{0}_2$ with limiting value of the phase wavefunction $\Phi(\phi) \to (2\pi)^{-1/2}$.
In this regime we distinguish two limits.
First, we suppose that inequality $\Lambda \ll \lambda < 1$ is holds.
In this case small enough $\lambda$ from (\ref{eq:potential}) one can obtain
%
{\red

%
\begin{equation}
V_F(z) \simeq -\lambda (1 - \lambda) \sin^2{z},
\end{equation}
%
and our Schrodinger equation transforms to the so-called Mathieu equation
%
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2 \Psi}{d z^2} + (a - 2q  \cos{2z}) \Psi = 0.
\end{equation}
%
where $a = E / \alpha + s^2 \lambda(1 - \lambda) / 2$, $q = s^2 \lambda (1 - \lambda)/ 4$.
We recall our boundary condition: $\Psi(z + 2\pi) = \Psi(z)$.
So, spectrum consist of all Mathieu functions $ce_0(z, q)$, $ce_1(z, q)$, $se_1(z, q)$, \dots, which are $2\pi$-periodic, and corresponding eigenvalues $a$ can be found using series expansions in powers of $q$ (see Abramowitz and Stegun). 
}

Another limit that could be studied within Fock regime is relevant to condition $\lambda \ll \Lambda$. In this case from (\ref{eq:potential}) we have $V_0(z) \simeq -\Lambda \cos{z}$.
In fact, this limit that deals with negligible $\lambda$ reproduces results for convenient quantum phase model \cite{Anglin}.


\section{Quantum-classical phase transitions \label{sec:quantum_classical}}

Strictly speaking, results established in previous section are completely valid at zero temperature. However, in current experiments with exciton polaritons  the condensate is observed at finite and high enough temperatures.
In this section we find answer to vital question: when quantum approach to the phase problem for Josephson junction utilizing weakly coupled exciton polariton condensate channels is valid?

To give an answer to this question we consider the effective $W$ -- like potential represented in Fig. \ref{phase_potential}b,c inherent to the Josephson, or Fock regimes, respectively.
To be more specific we examine here thermodynamically equilibrium system at finite temperature $T$.  Transition between to stable states (say, between points $z_{1,2}$ in Fig.\ref{phase_potential}b) can happen  either through the quantum tunneling or, in classical way, due to the thermal activation. 
Obviously, at high temperatures such as $k_{B}T\ge\Delta V$ ($\Delta V$ is height of the barrier between two states with minimum of potential energy) the particle undergoes hopping over the barrier governed by familiar thermoactivation (Arrhenius) escape rate $\Gamma \sim e^{-\Delta V /k_{B}T}$, cf. \cite{Larkin}.
On the other hand, in the ``low temperature'' limit $k_{B}T\ll\Delta V$ particle undergoes quantum tunneling through the barrier with the rate $\Gamma \sim e^{-B}$, where $B$ is the instanton action.
As it is discussed previously transition (crossover) between this two limits exhibits universal features of first or second order phase transitions which can be interpreted as phase transition between classical and quantum regimes, \cite{Chudnovsky_1997, Larkin, Owerre}.
Now we elucidate conditions for their realization for exciton polariton Josephson junction problem. 

Our description is based on imaginary time path integral approach, cf. \cite{Ankerhold}.
The imaginary-time action obtained within WKB method approaches as
%
\begin{equation}
S(E) = \oint (\tfrac{1}{2} m \dot{z}^2 + V(z)) d \tau.
\label{eq:thermon_action_1}
\end{equation}
%
The decay rate $\Gamma \sim e^{-S_{min}}$ according our approach can be expressed through the minimal value $S_{min}$ of the action.
The trajectories which are minimize the action $S_T$ satisfy to classical equation of motion for the thermon oscillating inside the inverted potential $-V(z)$, that is 
%
\begin{equation}
m \ddot{z} = \frac{d V}{dz}.
\label{eq:thermon}
\end{equation}
%
Periodic solutions for of Eq. (18) satisfy the relation
%
\begin{equation}
\tfrac{1}{2} m \dot{z}^2 = V(z) - E(\tau_p),
\label{eq:total_energy}
\end{equation}
%
where $\tau_p = \hbar / k_B T$ is a thermon period corresponding to the energy $E(\tau_p)$;
%
\begin{equation}
\tau_p(E) = \sqrt{2 m} \int_{z_1(E)}^{z_2(E)} \sqrt{V(z) - E} ~dz.
\label{eq:thermon_period}
\end{equation}
%
In (\ref{eq:thermon_period}) the $z_{1,2}(E)$ are turning points, cf. Fig. \ref{phase_potential}b.
The Eqs.(\ref{eq:total_energy}),(\ref{eq:thermon_period}) taken at energy $E = 0$ and temperature $T = 0$ characterize instanton solution.
The Eq. (\ref{eq:thermon_action_1}) with (\ref{eq:total_energy}) for thermon action can be rewritten in a form 
%
\begin{equation}
S_T = 2 \sqrt{2 m} \int_{z_1(E)}^{z_2(E)} \sqrt{V(z) - E} ~dz + E \tau_p (E).
\label{eq:thermon_action_2}
\end{equation}
%

To determine thermodynamic properties of the system it is necessary to know small amplitude oscillations behavior of the particle at the bottom, $z=0$, of inverted potential $-V(z)$.
The action in this case reads, {\red cf. \dots}:
%
\begin{equation}
S_0 = \Delta V \tau_p (E).
\label{eq:thermal_action}
\end{equation}
%

Expansion of the potential $V(z)$ excluding constant value $V(0)$ gives:
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lcl}

\end{array}
\label{eq:potential_teylor}
\end{equation}
%
In particularly, if the inverted potential $-V(z)$ has the form $z^2 - z^4$ the first order phase transition occurs.
If $-V(z)$ behaves as $z^2 + z^4$ second order phase transition take place.
Phase boundary between 1st and 2nd order phase transition is determined by the relation
%
\begin{equation}
\Lambda = \frac{1 - 16\lambda + 16\lambda^2 + \sqrt{1 + 32\lambda - 32\lambda^2}}{4(2\lambda - 1)}.
\label{eq:order_border}
\end{equation}
%
We summarize our results in the Fig.\ref{pic:phase_boundary_combined}.

The crossover temperature of second-order phase transition $T_{c}^{(2)} = \hbar \omega_0/ 2 \pi k_B$ is 
%
\begin{equation}
T_{c}^{(2)} = (\hbar \alpha s / \pi k_B) \sqrt{\lambda (1 - \lambda) + (2 \lambda - 1) \tfrac{\Lambda}{2} - \tfrac{1}{4} \Lambda^2},
\label{eq:second_order}
\end{equation}
%
where $\omega_0 = 2 \alpha s \sqrt{\lambda (1 - \lambda) + \tfrac{1}{2} (2 \lambda - 1) \Lambda - \tfrac{1}{4} \Lambda^2}$ is small oscillation frequency of thermon near the bottom of inverted potential.
From (\ref{eq:second_order}) follows that, for $\Lambda \ge 2\lambda$ there is no barrier at $z = 0$.

Fig. \ref{pic:action_period}a displays second-order phase transition from quantum (solid bold line of $S_T$) to thermal (classical) regimes --- dashed bold line of $S_0$.
The crossover occurs at the critical point $T_{c}^{(2)}$ where $S_T = S_0$ and {\red $E = E_0 = \dots$}.
The inset demonstrate monotonic dependence of thermon period $\tau_p$ on energy $E$ that is inherent to second-order phase transition.
Closest to the critical point with energy $E=E_0$ thermon undergoes small amplitude oscillations.  
  
In Fig. \ref{pic:action_period}b we represent results exhibiting first-order phase transition.
It is clearly seen that the first derivative of $S_{min}$ is discontinuous in this case and the dependence of thermon period $\tau_p$ on energy $E$ is non-monotonic (see inset in Fig. \ref{pic:action_period}b).
The critical temperature $T_{c}^{(1)}$ belongs to the temperature domain $T_{min} < T_{c}^{(1)} < T_{max}$ and can be find out numerically by solving Eqs.(\ref{eq:thermon_period}) - (\ref{eq:thermal_action}) under the condition $S_T = S_0$.
 
Analytically critical temperature $T_{c}^{(1)}$ one possible to approach as $T_{c}^{(1)} = \Delta V / B$, where $B$ is a instanton action that can be represented as $B = S(E_{min})$.
After some straightforward calculations for $B$ we obtain
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{c}
B = S(E_{min}) = 2 s \left[ \log \frac{2 \sqrt{\lambda} + \sqrt{4 \lambda^2 - \Lambda^2}}{2 \sqrt{\lambda} - \sqrt{4 \lambda^2 - \Lambda^2}} - \frac{\Lambda}{\sqrt{\lambda (1 - \lambda)}} \arctan \left( \frac{\sqrt{(1 - \lambda) (4 \lambda^2 - \Lambda^2)}}{\Lambda} \right) \right].
\end{array}
\label{eq:B_action}
\end{equation}
%

In current experiments it is much more easier to manipulate be the density of exciton polaritons instead of their temperature that is even difficult to identify due the some the non-equilibrium processes occurring in real microcavity samples, see e.g. \cite{Sanvitto,Guillet}.
For instance, the density of polariton gas can be manipulated by using the optical pump.
In Fig. \ref{pic:temperatures} we plot numerically calculated critical temperature of 1st and 2nd order phase transitions against $\Lambda$-parameter for experimentally accessible semiconductor Josephson junction samples.
The solid (green) line corresponds to analytical solution obtained with  Eq. (\ref{eq:B_action}).
Since the $\Lambda$-parameter is inversionally proportional to the density of exciton polariton gas (so-called blue shift) Fig. \ref{pic:temperatures} establishes important correspondence between critical temperatures discussed in the paper and relevant exciton polariton densities.

Another type of barrier --- upper barrier.
Exist when $\Lambda > 2(1 - \lambda)$.
Potential presumes local minima at $\pm 2K(\lambda)$ and local maxima at $z_{max} = \pm \cn^{-1} \left( -\frac{2(1 - \lambda)}{\Lambda} \right)$.
Equation for the thermon yeilds small ocsilation frequency near the bottom $z_{max}$ of the inverted potential $\omega_0 = \alpha s \sqrt{\frac{\Lambda^2}{1 - \lambda} - 4(1 - \lambda)}$.
The crossover temperature of second-order phase transition
%
\begin{equation}
T_{c}^{(2)} = (\hbar \alpha s / 2 \pi k_B) \sqrt{\frac{\Lambda^2}{1 - \lambda} - 4(1 - \lambda)}.
\label{eq:second_order_2}
\end{equation}
%
With the aim of analytical determining of the phase transition order let's write the Taylor series for $V(z)$ near the vicinity of $z_{max}$.
Expansion of the potential $V(z)$ excluding constant value $V(z_{max})$ gives:
%
\begin{equation}
V(\tilde{z}) = \alpha s^2 \Big[ -\tfrac{1}{4} \left( \tfrac{\Lambda^2}{1 - \lambda} - 4(1 - \lambda) \right) \tilde{z}^2 
+ \tfrac{1}{2} \tfrac{\Lambda \sqrt{\Lambda^2 - 4(1 - \lambda)^2}}{\sqrt{1 - \lambda} \sqrt{\Lambda^2 + 4 \lambda (1 - \lambda}} \tilde{z}^3 + o(\tilde{z}^4) \Big],
\label{eq:potential_teylor_2}
\end{equation}
%
where $\tilde{z} = z - z_{max}$.
It follows from (\ref{eq:potential_teylor_2}) that $-V(\tilde{z})$ aways has the form $\tilde{z}^2 - \tilde{z}^3$, as $\Lambda > 0$, so in this case only second-order phase transition occurs.
We plot typical behaviour of the $\tau(E)$, $S(T)$ and $T_{c}^{(2)}$ on Figs. \ref{pic:action_period_temperature_2}, and summarize our results on the Fig. \ref{pic:phase_boundary_combined}.

\section{Phase transitions in the presence of non-equilibrium processes 
\label{sec:non-equilibrium}}

Consider the influence of the dissipation in our system.
Supposing that $\Gamma = 0$, system with dissipation can be derived from hamiltonian and reads as
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lcl}
i \psi_{1, t} & = & -i \kappa \psi_1 +  \alpha |\psi_1|^2 \psi_1 - (B/2 - \beta \psi_1^* \psi_2) \psi_2; \\
i \psi_{2, t} & = & -i \kappa \psi_2 + \alpha |\psi_2|^2 \psi_2 - (B/2 - \beta \psi_2^* \psi_1) \psi_1.
\end{array}
\end{equation}
%
Change of variables: $\psi_{1,2} = \Psi_{1,2} \exp(-\kappa t)$.
System takes form
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lcl}
i \Psi_{1, t} & = & \alpha(t) |\Psi_1|^2 \Psi_1 - (B/2 - \beta(t) \Psi_1^* \Psi_2) \Psi_2; \\
i \Psi_{2, t} & = & \alpha(t) |\Psi_2|^2 \Psi_2 - (B/2 - \beta(t) \Psi_2^* \Psi_1) \Psi_1.
\end{array}
\end{equation}
%
It's equivalent to the non-dissipative system with time dependent parameters $\alpha(t) = \alpha \exp(-2 \kappa t)$, $\beta(t) = \beta \exp(-2 \kappa t)$.
Hamiltoninan in terms of Stocks operators (\ref{eq:pseudo_spin}):
%
\begin{equation}
\hat{H} = \alpha(t) \hat{S}_z^2 + \beta(t) \hat{S}_x^2 - B \hat{S}_x.
\end{equation}
%
Equaitions on the mean-values of operators:
% 
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lcl}
\dot{S}_z & = &  2 \beta(t) S_x S_y - B S_y; \\
\dot{S}_x & = & -2 \alpha(t) S_z S_y; \\
\dot{S}_y & = & 2(\alpha(t) - \beta(t)) S_z S_z + B S_z.
\end{array}
\end{equation}
%
Invariant of the system
%
\begin{equation}
S_x^2 + S_y^2 + S_z^2 = S_0^2 = R^2,
\end{equation}
%
where $R$ -- is a radius of the Poincare sphere.
Non-dissipative system has a bifurcation at the critical values of $\beta^* = B / 2R$.

It can be transformed to the equation on the phase difference $\phi$ and $S_z$ as follows
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lcl}
\dot{S}_z & = & B \sqrt{1 - S_z^2} \sin \phi - 2 \beta(t) (1 - S_z^2) \sin \phi \cos \phi; \\[10pt]
\dot{\phi} & = &  -2 \alpha(t) S_z + 2 \beta(t) S_z \cos^2 \phi - \dfrac{B S_z \cos \phi}{\sqrt{1 - S_z^2}}.
\end{array}
\end{equation}
%
We studied its dynamic numerically.
%
\begin{figure}[ht]
\center{\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{pic/phase_potential_dissipation.eps}}
\caption{\dots}
\label{pic:phase}
\end{figure}
%
Non-dissipative system hase two different regimes depend on different values of $B$: blue and red.
Case blue ($\beta > \beta^*$) corresponds to the existence of barrier, and the red case ($\beta < \beta^*$) corresponds to the absence of the barrier.

Linearization ($z \ll 1$, $\phi \ll 1$) of the system:
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lcl}
\dot{z} & = & (B - 2\beta(t)) \phi; \\
\dot{\phi} & = & (2 \beta(t) - 2 \alpha(t) - B) z.
\end{array}
\end{equation}
%
Adiabaticity condition:
%
\begin{equation}
\dfrac{1}{\omega^2(t)} \Big| \dfrac{d \omega}{d t} \Big| \ll 1.
\end{equation}
%
It allows us to reduce linear system to the harmonic oscillator equaiton with slowly evolving frequency:
%
\begin{equation}
\ddot{\phi} + \omega^2(t) \phi = 0,
\end{equation}
%
$\omega(t) = (B - 2\beta(t))(B - 2 \beta(t) + 2 \alpha(t))$.
We can approximate its solution as
%
\begin{equation}
\phi(\tau) \approx A / \sqrt{\omega(\tau)} \cos (\omega(\tau) \tau),
\end{equation}
%
where $\tau$ is the time elapsed after the oscillation sets in, and $A$ is an amplitude of oscillations at the moment $\tau = 0$.

\section{Conclusion \label{sec:conclusion}}

Practically, Fock regime interesting for high precision measurements.
In particular, the dispersion of the quantum phase in this case approaches to so-called Heisenberg limit ${<(\Delta\phi)^2> \propto \dfrac{1}{N^2}}$ which is the minimal accessible error for the phase measurement in respect of total particle number.

Practically two minima located at the points $A$ and $B$ of $W$-shape quantum phase potential in Fig. \ref{phase_potential}b can be used for initialization of exciton polariton qubit states $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$ similarly to superconductor flux qubits, respectively, {\red cf. [ ]}.
However, in our case such qubits much more easier to tailor by external optical or electrical pump {\red [ ]}.
Another interesting phenomena that can be obtained with potential in Fig. \ref{phase_potential}b is connected with some analogies in cosmology and quantum field theory.
In particular, in our recent work {\red [ ]} we discuss Higgs field generation by using exciton polaritons in semiconductor Bragg mirror structures as an on table analog of known cosmological phenomenon, {\red cf. [ ]}.
In this paper we continue our physical analogies with false vacuum decay (marked by the point $C$ in Fig. \ref{phase_potential}b) that can be established here, {\red cf. [ ]}.
